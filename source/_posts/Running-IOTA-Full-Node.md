I have been looking at [IOTA](https://www.iota.org/) since last winter, as it seems promising for IoT, Machine-to-Machine Micro-payments and Data Market scenarios.

Installing an IOTA light wallet is pretty straightforward, but running a full node is not. But thanks to the great [playbook](http://iri-playbook.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction.html), I managed to setup a Virtual Private Server to run as an IOTA full node. 
- 2 cores CPU 
- 4 GM memory
- SSD 
- Hosted 24/7 in a data center in Western Europe

## Setup steps ##
- Followed the steps in [playbook](http://iri-playbook.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction.html)
- Enabled remote access for the node, so the light wallet can connect to it.
- Setup firewall rules to allow IOTA node talking to internet
- Setup DNS to make the node more friendly for my neighbors
- Found good neighbors from IOTA Discord #nodesharing channel 
	Tips: go to #rank-yourself  and type "!rank fullnode", then you'll get access to the #nodesharing channel 

## Security! ##
There are lots of things you need to think about when you are hosting a 24/7 server on the internet. [This blog](https://x-vps.com/blog/?p=188) and [Security Hardening](http://iri-playbook.readthedocs.io/en/master/securityhardening.html) section provides a good guideline. 
- Use SSH key access
- Disable password authentication 
- Disable SSH root access

In addition, if you are using the [playbook installer ](http://iri-playbook.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting-started-quickly.html), you basically have the default user name and ports for your full node.** IT IS IMPORTANT TO CHANGE THEM!** Otherwise the attacker only need to crack the password, as they already know your user name (**iotapm**) and your ports.

### Update user name and password in bash ###
```bash
nano /opt/iri-playbook/group_vars/all/iotapm.yml
#update the following values
iotapm_nginx_user: new_user_account
iotapm_nginx_password: 'a-strong-password' 	

nano /opt/iri-playbook/group_vars/all/z-override-iotapm.yml
#update the following values
iotapm_nginx_user: new_user_account
iotapm_nginx_password: 'a-strong-password'
```
[reference](http://iri-playbook.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html#set-access-password) 

You can perform the following steps after you completed the installer.

### Update nginx user ###
1. Remove the default user iotpm
```bash
htpasswd -D /etc/nginx/.htpasswd iotpm
```
2. Create new user
```bash
htpasswd /etc/nginx/.htpasswd new_user_account
```

### Update system account in grafana ###
1. Stop grafana-server:
```bash
systemctl stop grafana-server
```
2. Delete grafanaâ€™s database:
```bash
rm -f /var/lib/grafana/grafana.db
```
3. Edit /etc/grafana/grafana.ini, set correct values for admin_user and admin_password (from above step)
4. Start grafana-server:
```bash
systemctl start grafana-server
```
5. re-install grafana by using iric, select "update monitoring"
