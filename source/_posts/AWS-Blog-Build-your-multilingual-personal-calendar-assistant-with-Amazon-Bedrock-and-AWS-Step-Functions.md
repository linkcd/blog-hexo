Check out [my latest blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-your-multilingual-personal-calendar-assistant-with-amazon-bedrock-and-aws-step-functions/) on AWS official AI/ML blog channel.

"Foreigners and expats living outside of their home country deal with a large number of emails in various languages daily. They often find themselves struggling with language barriers when it comes to setting up reminders for events like business gatherings and customer meetings. To solve this problem, this post shows you how to apply AWS services such as Amazon Bedrock, AWS Step Functions, and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to build a fully-automated multilingual calendar artificial intelligence (AI) assistant. It understands the incoming messages, translates them to the preferred language, and automatically sets up calendar reminders."

Happy reading!
