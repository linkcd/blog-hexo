## 1. Benefits of using for connecting EC2 instances
[AWS Systems Manager (SSM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html) is an AWS service that you can use to view and control your infrastructure on AWS. It can securely connect to a managed node. The SSM Agent is installed in EC2 OS. It is [pre-installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-ssm-agent.html) on many amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

With SSM:
- No need to open SSH port in security group for EC2
- No need to create and manage SSH keys

And SSM works regardless if the EC2 instance is in public or private (NAT or Endpoint) subnet.

## 2. EC2 Instance in public subnet
- 2.1. Make sure the EC2 instance has a public IP. It could be the public IP assigned during creation, or an Elastic IP.
- 2.2. EC2 instance should have Internet access (for calling SSM endpoint). In public subnet it is done via [Internet Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html). See details from [Session Manager prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-prerequisites.html), in "Connectivity to endpoints" section.
- 2.3. You can use [VPC Reachability Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/reachability/what-is-reachability-analyzer.html) to troubleshoot the connectivity between your EC2 and Internet gateway.
- 2.4. Create an EC2 Instance profile has IAM policy **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore**. Read the details from [Step 4: Create an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-instance-profile.html)
- 2.5  Attach the EC2 Instance profile to your instance.

## 3. EC2 instance in private subnet, with NAT connectivity
In this case, EC2 instances have no public IP, but they can still talk to internet via NAT.
- 3.1. Make sure EC2 instances in private subnet can access internet, via a [NAT Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) or [NAT instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html).
- 3.2. The rest will be the same as EC2 instances in public subnet, starting from 2.2

## 4. EC2 instance in private subnet, without NAT connectivity but VPC endpoints
In this case, the EC2 instance (no public IP) wonÂ´t have access internet via NAT but VPC endpoints, some extra works are required
- 4.1 [Create VPC endpoints for System Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-create-vpc.html#sysman-setting-up-vpc-create). Remember to allow HTTPS (port 443) outbound traffic in security group for your endpoint (ssm, ssmmessages and ec2messages)
- 4.2. Create an IAM Role as EC2 profile that contains [at least the following 2 policies]([bout policies for a Systems Manager instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-instance-profile.html#instance-profile-policies-overview)
 - aws managed policy **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore** 
 - [a custom policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-instance-profile.html#instance-profile-custom-s3-policy) for accessing an AWS owned S3 buckets.
- 4.3 Attach this instance profile to your EC2 instance
- 4.4 In addition, if your EC2 instance need to access other AWS services such as S3, remember to create needed endpoints for them as well.

## 5. Verification
Once the SSM is fully up-and-running, the EC2 instance (either in public/private subnet) will appear in Fleet Manager in SSM web console.
